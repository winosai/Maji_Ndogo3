This project involved confirming removing fake data and fighting corruption in Maji Ndogo.
It involves comparing datasets on water quality scores from a turned in data (auditor_report) and filtering errors from the data.
Investigating into this errors revealed some corruption during the survey for water sources in Maji Ndogo.
Getting the average number of mistakes and comparing with the number of mistakes made by certain employees enabled me get the employees that made above the average number of mistakes.
